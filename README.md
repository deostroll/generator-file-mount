# generator-file-mount 
> create an image and consequently mount it. 

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-file-mount using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-file-mount
```

Then generate your new project (in a working directory):

```bash
yo file-mount
```

This commands will create an image disk (`config.img`) in a specific format, and, create a folder `mnt`

Run `yo file-mount:mount` to attempt to mount.
